        <h1>Helo - A Gentle Introduction</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>What is "Helo"?</h2>
            <p>The term "Helo" is often encountered in the context of network communication, particularly in Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It's essentially a greeting that a client sends to a server to initiate a connection. Think of it as knocking on the door before entering. The client is announcing its presence and identifying itself to the server.</p>
            <p>The HELO command is the first command sent by the SMTP client to the SMTP server. It's a crucial step in establishing communication and preparing for the subsequent transfer of email messages. Without a proper HELO exchange, the server might refuse to accept any further commands or data from the client.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How HELO Works in SMTP</h2>
            <p>When an SMTP client wants to send an email, it first establishes a TCP connection to the SMTP server (typically on port 25). Once the connection is established, the client sends the HELO command, followed by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example:</p>
            <pre><code>HELO example.com</code></pre>
            <p>The server then responds with a status code and a greeting message. A successful response usually looks like this:</p>
            <pre><code>250 mail.example.com Hello example.com, pleased to meet you</code></pre>
            <p>The "250" code indicates success, and the message confirms that the server has acknowledged the client. The server often includes its own FQDN in the response.</p>
            <p>After the HELO exchange, the client can proceed with other SMTP commands like MAIL FROM (specifying the sender), RCPT TO (specifying the recipient), and DATA (containing the email content).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>EHLO: An Extended Version</h2>
            <p>In modern SMTP implementations, the EHLO (Extended HELO) command is preferred over HELO. EHLO allows the server to advertise its supported extensions, such as authentication mechanisms, STARTTLS for secure communication, and other capabilities. This enables the client to negotiate the most efficient and secure communication method.</p>
            <p>The EHLO exchange is similar to HELO, but the server's response will include a list of supported extensions:</p>
            <pre><code>EHLO example.com</code></pre>
            <p>A typical EHLO response might look like this:</p>
            <pre><code>250-mail.example.com Hello example.com [192.0.2.1]
250-SIZE 52428800
250-8BITMIME
250-STARTTLS
250 ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES</code></pre>
            <p>This response indicates that the server supports extensions like SIZE (maximum message size), 8BITMIME (handling 8-bit data), STARTTLS (TLS encryption), and ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES (more detailed error codes).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Importance of Proper HELO/EHLO</h2>
            <p>A properly configured HELO/EHLO command is crucial for email deliverability. Many email servers and spam filters use the HELO/EHLO domain to verify the legitimacy of the sending server. If the HELO/EHLO domain doesn't match the sending server's IP address or DNS records, the email is more likely to be flagged as spam or rejected outright.</p>
            <p>Therefore, it's essential to ensure that your email server or application is configured to send a valid and consistent HELO/EHLO domain. This helps establish trust with receiving servers and improves your email deliverability rates.</p>
